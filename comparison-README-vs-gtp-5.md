# Comparison: README.md vs redhat-best-practice-gtp-5.md

This document summarizes the content differences between the canonical analysis in `README.md` and the GPT-5 generated analysis in `redhat-best-practice-gtp-5.md`.

## Summary of Differences

- Title line differs (Complete Analysis vs GPT-5 Analysis)
- GPT-5 file includes an attribution note after Sources
- Footer version line differs (1.0 vs 2.0 (GPT-5))
- All test suite sections, tables, impacts, and references are otherwise aligned

## Side-by-side Key Differences
